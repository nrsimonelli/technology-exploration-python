# Exploring Python

- installed version 3 using homebrew
- installsed VSCode extensions for formatting and file management
- explored testing, debugging, and simple functions

## Testing

> credit John Fincher for tutorial code and sample files

- using terminal and the file manager icon ran through sample test located in expr_text.py
- debugging example and syntax also provided

## My First Code

- printed hello world
- basic arythmitic
- logic statements
- ended with relationship function

## TBC 

- looking forward to diving into loops, more if statements, and the equivalent of bindings, this, classes, etc.
